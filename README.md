My Flatiron Frontend Phase 1 Project

First of all I want to thank my instructors for their guidance.
The applicatin it's very simple, I have created a json db to showcast some of the best soccer teams in Europe.
Each tag displays an image with the teams logo, now if you click on the show information button some history as well as the coache's name will show up.
I have included some already, but anybody can add their favorite European team in the simple form I have added to it, you will have to have your own url to include an image or logo.
The technologies I have use in order to create this simple application are html, css & javascript.
In order for it to work I have to start json server and open index html.
I am not accepting or looking for any contributions.
